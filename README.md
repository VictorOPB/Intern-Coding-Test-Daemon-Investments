Descriptive Data Analysis:
 Market stocks can be mathematically described as a collection of random variables indexed by a discrete mathematical set, usually corresponding to time measured in days, months or years. This behavior is extremely similar to stochastic processes, mathematical objects used to describe systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner.
 The provided simulated sample gives ten normally distributed returns datasets. Such datasets are typically known as Wiener processes or Geometric Brownian Motion    processes, which is a stochastic process with stationary and independent increments that are normally distributed based on the size of the increments. Wiener process is used as a basis to Black–Scholes–Merton model, widely applied in financial markets and, therefore, the statistical behavior of the simulated sample is a valid aproximation to market data.
